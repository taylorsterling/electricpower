                <h2>Electric Power Industry</h2>
                <p id="introtext">The electric power industry covers the generation, transmission,
                    distribution and sale of electric power to the general public and industry. The commercial
                    distribution of electric power started in 1882 when electricity was produced for electric lighting.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s, growing economic and safety concerns lead to the regulation of the
                    industry. What was once an expensive novelty limited to the most densely populated areas, reliable
                    and economical electric power has become an essential aspect for normal operation of all elements
                    of developed economies.</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="lead">Although electricity had been known to be produced as a result of the chemical reactions that
            take place in an electrolytic cell since Alessandro Volta developed the voltaic pile in 1800, its
            production by this means was, and still is, expensive. In 1831, Michael Faraday devised a machine that
            generated electricity from rotary motion, but it took almost 50 years for the technology to reach a
            commercially viable stage. In 1878, in the United States, Thomas Edison developed and sold a commercially
            viable replacement for gas lighting and heating using locally generated and distributed direct current
            electricity.

            The world's first public electricity supply was provided in late 1881, when the streets of the Surrey town
            of Godalming in the UK were lit with electric light. This system was powered from a water wheel on the
            River Wey, which drove a Siemens alternator that supplied a number of arc lamps within the town. This
            supply scheme also provided electricity to a number of shops and premises to light 34 incandescent Swan
            light bulbs.</p>
